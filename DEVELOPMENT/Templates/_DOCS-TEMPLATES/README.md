# Documentation Templates Guide
*Version: 1.0.0*

## Quick Start

1. Copy templates to your project:
```bash
# From your project root
cp -r /path/to/_DOCS-TEMPLATES ./_DOCS
cd _DOCS
```

2. Remove this README and initialize your docs:
```bash
# Remove template README
rm _README.md

# Start with essential docs for your project size:
# Small project: Keep PROJECT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DEV-GUIDE.md
# Full project: Keep all docs and fill gradually
```

3. Fill out documentation using AI assistance:
```bash
# Start with these in order:
1. PROJECT.md     # Define project scope
2. ARCHITECTURE.md # Design system
3. DEV-GUIDE.md   # Setup instructions
# Continue with others as needed
```

This directory contains a comprehensive set of documentation templates for software projects. These templates are designed to be flexible and can be adapted for projects of any size.

## Essential vs Optional Documentation

### Essential for All Projects
- PROJECT.md (Vision and Overview)
- ARCHITECTURE.md (System Design)
- DEV-GUIDE.md (Setup Instructions)
- API-SPEC.md (If has API)
- DATA-MODEL.md (Data Structures)
- SECURITY.md (Basic Security)

### Optional for Simple Projects
- MONITORING.md (For complex systems)
- ERROR-HANDLING.md (For distributed systems)
- ROADMAP.md (For longer-term projects)
- CHANGELOG.md (For versioned releases)
- UI-SPEC.md (For simple UIs)

### Recommended for Team Projects
- CONTRIBUTING.md (Team collaboration)
- TESTING.md (Quality assurance)
- USE-CASES.md (Business logic)

## Using AI to Fill Templates

### Basic Approach
1. Start with PROJECT.md to define scope
2. Use AI to expand core documents based on project scope
3. Add optional documents as needed

### AI Prompting Tips
1. **Project Definition**
   ```
   "Help me define the [PROJECT NAME] in PROJECT.md with these key features:
   - Feature 1
   - Feature 2
   - Target users
   - Main goals"
   ```

2. **Architecture Design**
   ```
   "Based on PROJECT.md, help me design the system architecture with:
   - Main components
   - Data flow
   - Integration points"
   ```

3. **Technical Details**
   ```
   "Help me specify the technical requirements for [component/feature] including:
   - API endpoints
   - Data models
   - Security measures"
   ```

### Best Practices
1. Provide clear, specific requirements
2. Review and adjust AI output
3. Keep documentation focused and concise
4. Update iteratively as project evolves

### AI Tools Integration
- Use AI for initial content generation
- Use AI for documentation updates
- Use AI for consistency checks
- Use AI for format validation

## Template Usage

1. Copy needed templates to your project
2. Replace [PROJECT NAME] with your project name
3. Fill in sections progressively
4. Update version numbers as content changes
5. Remove unnecessary sections
6. Add project-specific details

Remember: Documentation should be living and evolve with your project. Start with the essentials and expand as needed.
